    This script takes in a file where every line is a database accession number and then searches
    the ENA database for sequences pertaining to it.  Couple notes. First, we're only searching the
    assembly database. If somebody has sequenced a strain but didn't bother assembling and uploading
    it we miss it. Second, we're literally just searching the accession number (i.e. NCTC10); if 
    somebody decided to get cute with naming we miss it. 

    3 required options:

    -i, --input:    path to input file where every line is db accession (w/o space)
    -o, --output:   Path to desired output base directory. Within this folder, the 
                    structure will be database_accession/assembly_accession/*
    -t, --type:     Database type we're looking in. i.e. 'NCTC' or 'CIP'
