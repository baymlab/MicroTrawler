yeet. first day working on this. what's the plan mama jam? im gonna take ATCC, NCTC, and CIP. scrape'em for all bacterial accession numbers that meet certain criteria! 
I think I can just use shell scripts to meme on each page? let's first look at ATCC...

Ok based on curl ATCC output looks like a HOT mess. I could try interfacing with Python? But that's such a meme. Hopefully the other websites are not LITERAL
javascript trash

Ok. I've spent some time looking through NCTC and CIP websites. They do seem more informative than ATCC, but tbh everything seems like it'll be a pain in the ass. 
I'll probably start looking for nice APIs to query websites in a GUI-centric fashion. Of note, I found a strain for which I would like to derive some info and analysis on.

It is Streptococcus gordonii. Allegedly cultured from a patient with gum disease (Pyorrhoea), it's accession numbers are: NCTC 3165, ATCC 33399, DSM 20568, CIP 103221. 
According to all collections, it was first deposited in 1930 by one D. Thomson of the Pickett-Thomson Research Laboratory to NCTC. But I cannot find any information
about the Pickett-Thomson Research Laboratory, all I can find with their name are reviews of a research magazine they used to publish called 'Annals of the Pickett-Thompson
Research Laboratory'.
